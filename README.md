# Dentist-Appointment-App
This is an entreprise level java application to view, edit and schedule denitist appointments.
The client will be able to log in with their customer id number to view their appointment.
If they do not have an appointment they can make one by selecting a date and time. 
They can also edit personal information. 
The dentist can log on to view all his scheduled appoints 
The dentist can also edit his or her personal information.

I used SQL to pull from the database using microsoft access jbdc 
The login uses a servlet to compare the user input to the information in the database.
I used business objects, servlets, jsp's, HTML and CSS in this project
